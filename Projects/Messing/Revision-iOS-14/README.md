## Property wrappers
They wrap a property so that processing can be done on set and get in a more flexible way than before.
https://nshipster.com/propertywrapper/ has some good examples of how this could be used.

## Keypaths
Keypaths are designed to allow you to refer to properties without actually invoking them â€“ you hold a reference to the property itself, rather than reading its value.
Check out the Keypaths playground in the Developer folder.
These existed in ObjectiveC but there was no typing there.
