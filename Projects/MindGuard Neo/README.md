#  Mindguard Neo

## Overview of the App

This is an adaptation of the old MindGuard put together with new technologies.
(obsolete) The base system for this new version will be iOS 11 because I would like to use the new pin clustering system on the map view.

## Application tabs
- Scan - A table of scan results, Use the same categories as the old app, But add a few new carriers
- Hitmap - A map view showing the latest as well as the greatest hits.
- Psident - Contains the biorythms and such
- Depsych - SpriteKit
- Settings

## Things ToDo
- Decode the messages from the old carrier files.
- Notifications of hits.
- (done) Decide on the graphic technologies that we're going to use for the Depsych.
