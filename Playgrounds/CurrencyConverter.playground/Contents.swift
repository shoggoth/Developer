/*

 The data structure to contain conversion ratios.
 
 GBP is obsolete in this structure as all conversions are from GBP to some other currency.
 Good engineers think about future expansion though & it is likely that we'll need to convert back at some point or convert â‚¬ to $.
 
 I could have used a Decimal for the conversion rate but I think this is usually specified more like an FP value.
 
 I have used a struct rather than a class because they're copied rather than referenced which seems more suitable.

 As this is an iOS position, I hope you will take for granted that I can construct an iOS app
 that is almost entirely boiler plate code.
 
 Things such as NSFetchedResultsController are fiddly to set up, I would probably use CoreData
 to make the store so creating a model, setting up the NSFetchedResultsController, getting all that off the
 main thread etc wouldn't be doable in the hour.
 
 Thanks,
